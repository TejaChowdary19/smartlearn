## Python Programming Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types
Variables in Python are containers for storing data values. Python has several built-in data types:
- **Integers**: Whole numbers like 42, -17, 1000
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.001, 2.0
- **Strings**: Text enclosed in quotes like "Hello", 'Python', """Multi-line"""
- **Booleans**: True or False values
- **Lists**: Ordered collections like [1, 2, 3, "hello"]
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs like {"name": "John", "age": 30}

### Control Structures
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Key control structures include:
- **if/elif/else**: Conditional execution
- **for loops**: Iterate over sequences
- **while loops**: Execute while condition is True
- **try/except**: Handle exceptions gracefully

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that can accept parameters and return values:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function call
message = greet("Alice")
```

## Machine Learning Basics

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn patterns:
- **Classification**: Categorize data into classes (e.g., spam/not spam)
- **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices)

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data:
- **Clustering**: Group similar data points together
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce number of features while preserving information

### Key Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values using linear relationships
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model for classification and regression
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines**: Find optimal hyperplane for classification

## Mathematics for Data Science

### Linear Algebra
- **Vectors**: Ordered lists of numbers representing direction and magnitude
- **Matrices**: Rectangular arrays of numbers used for transformations
- **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**: Special vectors that don't change direction under transformation

### Statistics
- **Mean**: Average of a dataset
- **Median**: Middle value when data is sorted
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of data spread around the mean
- **Correlation**: Measure of relationship between two variables

### Calculus
- **Derivatives**: Rate of change of a function
- **Integrals**: Area under a curve or accumulation of change
- **Gradients**: Vector of partial derivatives for optimization

## Study Techniques

### Active Learning
- **Practice Testing**: Self-quizzing to improve retention
- **Distributed Practice**: Spacing study sessions over time
- **Interleaving**: Mixing different topics in study sessions
- **Elaboration**: Explaining concepts in your own words

### Memory Techniques
- **Chunking**: Breaking information into manageable pieces
- **Mnemonic Devices**: Memory aids like acronyms or rhymes
- **Visualization**: Creating mental images to remember concepts
- **Association**: Linking new information to existing knowledge

### Time Management
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused work sessions with breaks
- **Time Blocking**: Scheduling specific time slots for different tasks
- **Priority Matrix**: Categorizing tasks by urgency and importance
- **Goal Setting**: Setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals

## Effective Note-Taking

### Cornell Method
Divide your paper into three sections:
- **Main Notes**: Key concepts and details
- **Cues**: Questions and keywords in the left margin
- **Summary**: Brief summary at the bottom

### Mind Mapping
- Start with a central concept
- Branch out with related ideas
- Use colors and images for visual appeal
- Connect related concepts with lines

### Digital Tools
- **Note-taking apps**: Evernote, OneNote, Notion
- **Mind mapping software**: XMind, MindMeister
- **Flashcard apps**: Anki, Quizlet
- **Collaboration tools**: Google Docs, Microsoft Teams
