# 🚀 SmartLearn RAG Integration Guide

## Overview

SmartLearn now features **full RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) integration**, making your AI responses more accurate and contextually relevant by leveraging your knowledge base.

## ✨ What RAG Does

**Before RAG**: AI generates responses based only on its pre-trained knowledge
**With RAG**: AI enhances responses by retrieving relevant information from your knowledge base

### Benefits:
- 🎯 **More Accurate**: Responses incorporate your specific domain knowledge
- 📚 **Contextual**: AI understands your specific materials and references
- 🔍 **Searchable**: Find relevant information across your documents
- 🚀 **Enhanced**: Better study plans, explanations, and quizzes

## 🛠️ How to Use RAG

### 1. Enable RAG in the Sidebar
- Check the "Enable RAG (Knowledge Base)" checkbox
- Set your knowledge base path (default: `data/knowledge_base/`)

### 2. Load Your Knowledge Base
- Click "🔄 Load Knowledge Base" button
- The system will process all documents in your specified directory
- You'll see a success message with the number of chunks loaded

### 3. Use RAG-Enhanced Features
Once loaded, RAG automatically enhances:
- **Study Plans**: Incorporates relevant concepts from your knowledge base
- **Explanations**: Uses your materials for more accurate explanations
- **Quizzes**: Generates questions based on your specific content

## 📁 Supported File Types

The RAG system supports these document formats:
- `.txt` - Plain text files
- `.md` - Markdown files
- `.py` - Python source code
- `.js` - JavaScript files
- `.html` - HTML files
- `.css` - CSS files
- `.json` - JSON data files

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Document Processing
- **Chunking**: Documents are split into 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap
- **Embeddings**: Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for semantic understanding
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for efficient similarity search

### Retrieval Process
1. **Query Processing**: Your input is converted to embeddings
2. **Similarity Search**: Finds most relevant document chunks
3. **Context Integration**: Relevant context is added to AI prompts
4. **Enhanced Generation**: AI generates responses using both its knowledge and your content

### RAG Status Display
The sidebar shows:
- ✅ Knowledge base status (loaded/not loaded)
- 📊 Number of document chunks
- 🤖 Embedding model being used
- 🔍 Search functionality for your knowledge base

## 📚 Sample Knowledge Base

We've included a comprehensive sample knowledge base in `data/knowledge_base/sample_notes.md` covering:
- Python Programming Fundamentals
- Machine Learning Basics
- Mathematics for Data Science
- Study Techniques
- Effective Note-Taking
- Problem-Solving Strategies
- Learning Resources

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Documents
Place your educational materials in the `data/knowledge_base/` directory:
```
data/
└── knowledge_base/
    ├── python_basics.md
    ├── math_notes.txt
    ├── study_guide.pdf
    └── your_notes.md
```

### 2. Enable RAG
- Open SmartLearn
- Check "Enable RAG (Knowledge Base)"
- Click "Load Knowledge Base"

### 3. Experience Enhanced AI
- Generate study plans that reference your materials
- Get explanations that incorporate your notes
- Take quizzes based on your specific content

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Knowledge Base Search
Use the search bar in the RAG status section to:
- Find specific topics across your documents
- See relevance scores for search results
- Explore your knowledge base content

### Customization
- **Chunk Size**: Modify `chunk_size` in `EnhancedRAG` class
- **Overlap**: Adjust `chunk_overlap` for better context
- **Retrieval Count**: Change `k` parameter for more/less context

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Knowledge base not loaded"**
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure documents are in supported formats
- Verify file permissions

**"RAG retrieval failed"**
- Check if documents contain text content
- Verify embedding model is working
- Check system memory for large documents

**"No relevant documents found"**
- Try different search terms
- Check if your knowledge base covers the topic
- Verify document content quality

### Performance Tips:
- Keep documents under 10MB each
- Use clear, structured content
- Avoid heavily formatted documents
- Regular cleanup of old/unused documents

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned RAG improvements:
- **PDF Support**: Direct PDF document processing
- **Image Recognition**: Extract text from images/diagrams
- **Multi-language**: Support for non-English documents
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic knowledge base refresh
- **Advanced Search**: Filters, tags, and metadata search

## 📖 API Reference

### EnhancedRAG Class

```python
from core.rag import EnhancedRAG

# Initialize RAG system
rag = EnhancedRAG()

# Load knowledge base
success = rag.load_knowledge_base("path/to/documents")

# Retrieve relevant context
context, sources = rag.retrieve_relevant_context("your query", k=3)

# Search documents
results = rag.search_similar_documents("search term", k=5)

# Get statistics
stats = rag.get_knowledge_base_stats()
```

### Key Methods:
- `load_knowledge_base(path)`: Load documents from directory
- `retrieve_relevant_context(query, k)`: Get relevant context for AI prompts
- `search_similar_documents(query, k)`: Search knowledge base
- `get_knowledge_base_stats()`: Get system status and statistics

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Document Organization:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Organize by subject/topic
- Keep related concepts together
- Use consistent formatting

### Content Quality:
- Write clear, concise explanations
- Include examples and definitions
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Avoid overly complex language

### Maintenance:
- Regularly update your knowledge base
- Remove outdated information
- Organize content logically
- Backup important documents
